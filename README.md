A game of chance for the most degenerate gamblers on the Binance Smart Chain, with only one winner.

The SQTTO token contract is built on the Binance Smart Chain with a total supply of 45,000 SQTTO. Holders need to acquire SQTTO to participate in the first round of Squid Lotto, with each token representing one entry to the lottery.

Purchase transactions will be limited to 100 tokens per transaction, both during public sale and on Pancake Swap to ensure a fair distribution among participants.

Once you dare to join, there is no leaving the game, the tokens can not be sold back to the DEX pool.

If 50% of the SQTTO supply is voted towards ending the game on Snapshot.org or all tokens are bought from the market the winner will be drawn.

Upon the conclusion of the game, a winning wallet will be chosen at random, utilizing a cryptographically secure random number generator.
